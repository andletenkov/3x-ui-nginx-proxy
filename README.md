Automated deployment of a Cloudflare-fronted 3x-ui/Xray server, with optional
direct-connection transports for when a CDN alone isn't enough. It installs
and configures 3x-ui, Nginx, wildcard TLS, UFW, Cloudflare origin protection,
VLESS transports (WS/gRPC/XHTTP with VLESS Encryption + XTLS-Vision),
subscriptions, routing, optional VLESS+Reality, optional NaiveProxy, and
optional host hardening.

## What it sets up

      NginxHTTP --> WS[VLESS WebSocket]
      NginxHTTP --> GRPC[VLESS gRPC]
      NginxHTTP --> XHTTP[VLESS XHTTP]
    end
```

When neither Reality nor NaiveProxy is enabled, the stream SNI Guard doesn't
exist at all and Nginx binds 443 directly, exactly as in the CDN-only setup.
It only appears once a direct-connection feature needs to share port 443.

| Component | Configuration |
|---|---|
| Panel | Private loopback listener, proxied by Nginx on its own subdomain and secret path |
| VLESS/WS | Loopback Xray listener proxied through Nginx HTTPS, VLESS Encryption (ML-KEM-768) |
| VLESS/gRPC | Loopback Xray listener proxied through Nginx HTTP/2, VLESS Encryption (ML-KEM-768) |
| VLESS/XHTTP | Loopback Xray listener using `packet-up`, proxied with Nginx `grpc_pass`, VLESS Encryption + XTLS-Vision |
| VLESS/Reality *(optional)* | Direct connection (no CDN), donor-site impersonation, no VLESS Encryption needed (no MITM-capable proxy in front) |
| NaiveProxy *(optional)* | Direct connection (no CDN), Caddy + forwardproxy, reuses the same wildcard cert |
| Subscription | Loopback listener proxied through the panel hostname |
| TLS | Let's Encrypt wildcard certificate via Cloudflare DNS-01, shared by the CDN inbounds and NaiveProxy |
| Origin firewall | TCP/443 open to everyone -- direct-connection features (Reality, NaiveProxy) need it; the stream SNI Guard, not the firewall, is what keeps random probes off the real inbounds |
| Routing | Direct traffic plus WARP routing for configured Russian/OpenAI rules; private and BitTorrent traffic blocked |

## Scripts

| Script | Role |
|---|---|
| `setup.sh` | Main entry point. Installs, updates, configures, verifies, and uninstalls the complete stack, including NaiveProxy and the Nginx stream SNI Guard. |
| `setup-3x-ui.sh` | Internal helper that installs/reuses 3x-ui and creates WS, gRPC, XHTTP, Reality, subscription, and Xray routing configuration. |
| `harden-host.sh` | Optional host hardening for clock sync, DNS-over-TLS, sysctl, ICMP, TTL, banners, and BBR. Invoked by `setup.sh`. |

Use `setup.sh` for normal operation. The helper scripts can be run directly only for their respective `--uninstall` actions.

## Prerequisites

- Debian or Ubuntu VPS; run as `root`.
- Domain hosted by Cloudflare.
- Cloudflare API token with `Zone:DNS:Edit` permission.
- The panel and VLESS (WS/gRPC/XHTTP) hostnames must remain **orange-cloud proxied**.
- The optional Reality and NaiveProxy hostnames must be **DNS-only (grey cloud)** --
  they are direct connections to the VPS and cannot go through Cloudflare's proxy
  at all (Cloudflare would terminate their TLS, breaking Reality entirely and
  defeating NaiveProxy's point).
- TCP/443 is open to the whole internet, not just Cloudflare -- direct-
  connection hostnames need it, so there is no source-IP restriction on it
  any more. What keeps unmatched traffic off the real inbounds is the Nginx
  stream SNI Guard's decoy branch, not the firewall.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/andletenkov/3x-ui-cf-setup.git
cd 3x-ui-cf-setup
chmod +x setup.sh setup-3x-ui.sh harden-host.sh
sudo ./setup.sh
```

The setup asks for the base domain, panel/VLESS subdomains, email, and internal
ports. It generates unique paths and ports when no saved values exist. 3x-ui
creates the panel credentials and secret panel path itself; the resulting
credentials and VLESS links are printed at completion.

New VLESS clients are explicitly enabled by default.

### Optional fallback page

By default, unmatched paths on the VLESS hostname return `404`. To serve a
single fallback page at `/`, pass a readable HTML file:

```bash
sudo FALLBACK_HTML_PATH=./examples/fallback.html ./setup.sh
```

The page is copied to `/etc/nginx/3xui-proxy-fallback.html`. Only `/` serves
the page; unmatched paths still return `404`. Run without `FALLBACK_HTML_PATH`
to remove the installed fallback page and restore `404` at `/`.

### XHTTP through Cloudflare

The generated XHTTP inbound uses:

```json
{
  "network": "xhttp",
  "security": "none",
  "xhttpSettings": { "path": "/api/vN/...", "mode": "packet-up" }
}
```

`security: none` applies only to the loopback Nginx-to-Xray hop; Nginx
terminates public TLS. XHTTP `packet-up` sends session and sequence suffixes
below its configured path, so Nginx forwards the complete path prefix with
`grpc_pass`.

In Cloudflare, enable **Network → gRPC** for the zone. Keep the VLESS hostname
orange-cloud proxied. Import the XHTTP URI generated by the panel or setup
output; it must use the same path and `mode=packet-up`.

### VLESS Encryption and XTLS-Vision

WS/gRPC/XHTTP inbounds generate an ML-KEM-768 keypair the first time
`setup.sh` runs and reuse it on every rerun. It's applied independently of
Cloudflare's own TLS layer, so Cloudflare (or anything else terminating the
outer TLS session) cannot read the actual proxied payload. XHTTP additionally
gets `flow: xtls-rprx-vision`, which VLESS Encryption unlocks for that
transport (Vision otherwise only works over raw TCP). Reality does not use
VLESS Encryption -- there's no CDN/reverse-proxy TLS termination in front of
it to protect against in the first place.

### Optional: VLESS+Reality (direct connection, no CDN)

Leave the prompt blank to skip this feature entirely. If enabled, you provide:

- a **DNS-only** subdomain (its A/AAAA record must point directly at the VPS,
  proxy status off), and
- a **donor site** for Reality to impersonate -- a real, unrelated, popular
  site (e.g. `github.com`), never a domain of your own. Anyone who reaches
  this inbound without a valid Reality handshake gets transparently relayed
  to the real donor site's real response.

The inbound shares port 443 with everything else via the Nginx stream SNI
Guard, dispatching by the TLS ClientHello's SNI before any TLS termination
happens -- Reality's own TLS session is untouched end-to-end.

### Optional: NaiveProxy (direct connection, no CDN)

Also disabled by default (blank subdomain = skipped). If enabled, `setup.sh`
downloads the latest [klzgrad/naiveproxy](https://github.com/klzgrad/naiveproxy)
release (a Caddy build bundling the naive fork of `forwardproxy`), generates a
username/password, and runs it as a systemd service. Caddy binds loopback
only and reuses the same wildcard certificate as the CDN inbounds -- it does
not run its own ACME flow. It's reached the same way as Reality: via the
Nginx stream SNI Guard on port 443, using its own DNS-only subdomain.

Anyone reaching the NaiveProxy hostname without valid forward-proxy
credentials sees an ordinary decoy webpage (the same content as
`FALLBACK_HTML_PATH`, or a generic default page if that's unset) via Caddy's
`file_server`, not an error.

## Update safely

```bash
cd 3x-ui-cf-setup
git pull
sudo ./setup.sh
```

Saved settings are loaded automatically. Re-running updates Nginx, UFW,
Cloudflare IP ranges, certificates/hooks, host-hardening settings, and missing
inbounds. Existing inbounds and clients are not recreated or changed, so active
client connections are preserved.

Cloudflare origin ranges are refreshed every time `setup.sh` runs. Cloudflare
does not publish a guaranteed change cadence; run updates periodically to
refresh the firewall rules.

### Pin the 3x-ui version

```bash
sudo XUI_VERSION=v3.4.0 ./setup.sh
```

Without `XUI_VERSION`, a fresh 3x-ui installation uses the latest stable
upstream release. It is ignored when 3x-ui already exists.

## Uninstall

```bash
sudo ./setup.sh --uninstall
```

This removes the Nginx site, the stream SNI Guard config (and its `nginx.conf`
include), Cloudflare real-IP configuration, UFW rules, Certbot hook,
Cloudflare token, saved state, 3x-ui, NaiveProxy (service, binary, Caddyfile),
and host hardening. The wildcard certificate is retained by default to avoid
Let's Encrypt issuance limits.

```bash
sudo ./setup.sh --uninstall --delete-cert
```

Use the extra flag only when the certificate should also be removed.

## Host hardening

`setup.sh` runs host hardening as a best-effort step. To apply or revert it
separately:

```bash
sudo ./harden-host.sh
sudo ./harden-host.sh --uninstall
```

Environment overrides:

```bash
sudo DNS_RESOLVERS='9.9.9.9#dns.quad9.net 149.112.112.112#dns.quad9.net' \
  DNS_OVER_TLS_MODE=yes DNSSEC_MODE=yes ./harden-host.sh
```

## Security model and limitations

- Cloudflare's proxy cannot terminate/forward REALITY or NaiveProxy traffic --
  those features intentionally use separate, DNS-only hostnames that bypass
  Cloudflare entirely. Enabling either of them means the VPS's real IP is
  discoverable via those specific DNS records (though not via the panel/VLESS
  CDN hostnames, which stay proxied).
- TCP/443 is open to everyone once Reality or NaiveProxy is enabled -- the
  Nginx stream SNI Guard, not the firewall, is what decides whether a given
  connection reaches a real inbound or the decoy vhost, based on the TLS
  ClientHello's SNI.
- The Cloudflare API token and generated state files use mode `600`.
- SSH is never modified by `setup.sh`; ensure your own SSH UFW access exists
  before enabling UFW on a new host.
- VLESS Encryption (WS/gRPC/XHTTP) and Reality's own handshake are
  independent of Cloudflare's TLS layer, so this setup does not rely on
  Cloudflare being trustworthy w.r.t. reading the actual proxied payload for
  either of them.
